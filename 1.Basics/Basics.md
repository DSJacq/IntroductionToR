# Basics


To learn more about R's history and recent developments, you can visit www.r-project.org; it's the basis of the entire R community. Here, you will find guidelines to get started with R on your own local system. Next, you can head over to RStudio [http://www.rstudio.com/], to install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to work with R. Writing your own scripts, developing packages and using version control are made easy with this software. 

For a structured overview of the basic data types that are used in R, you can visit R Tutorial [http://www.r-tutor.com/r-introduction/basic-data-types] to learn more about different elementary concepts.
